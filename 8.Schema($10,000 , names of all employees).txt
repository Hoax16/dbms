a) Find the names, street address, and cities of residence for all employees who work for the same company and earn more than $10,000:
SELECT e.employee_name, e.street, e.city
FROM employee e
WHERE e.employee_name IN (
    SELECT w.employee_name
    FROM works w
    WHERE w.salary > 10000
    GROUP BY w.employee_name
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT w.company_name) = 1
);

b) Find the names of all employees in the database who live in the same cities as the companies for which they work:

SELECT e.employee_name
FROM employee e
WHERE e.city IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT c.city
    FROM company c
    WHERE c.company_name IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT w.company_name
        FROM works w
        WHERE w.employee_name = e.employee_name

c) Find the names of all employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees of their company:

SELECT w.employee_name
FROM works w
WHERE w.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(w1.salary)
    FROM works w1
    WHERE w1.company_name = w.company_name
